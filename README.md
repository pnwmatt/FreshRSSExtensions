# PNWMatt's Extensions for FreshRSS

## DeepLink

This extension updates your browser's URL to include the unique ID for the article you are currently reading.  Sharing that link with others while anonymous reading is enabled allows guests to read the article with a minimum FreshRSS UI.

Roadmap/to-dos:
  - [Not started] Only hydrate the one article when loading the php, instead of the full hydration that happens
  - [Not started] Open Graph tags for sharing: this is blocked on needing a Minz hook to inject html into the `<head>` tag.
